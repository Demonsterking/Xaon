This is the first console version of the application developed using pure python scientific libraries like numpy and sklearn.
The motive was to implemnt a basic neural network without using any available libraries and to understand the working thoroughly.


trainData.py-->used for preprocessing of Data
net.py-->First version of the program
net2.py-->Revised version of net.py with focus on matrix operations
net3.py-->Final version of the console applicaiton which supports minibatch and regularization concepts.
          Minibatch highly aids in reducing computaional time by vectorising code which is handled by numpy.
